IMAGE TO TEXT CONVERSATION 
              Overview
In this project we deal with automation of image, pdf to text using OCR and other tools in python programming language.
Goals
IMAGE TO TEXT CONVERSATION: The basic goal of the project is to convert the image or pdf input made by the user  to text file.
REQUIREMENT 
Anaconda Navigator 
Anaconda Navigator is a desktop GUI it makes it easy to launch applications and manage packages and environments without using command-line commands.
Jupyter notebook 
The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application                 that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text.



To perform the IMAGE TO TEXT CONVERSATION 
Install tesseract by following steps.
          The latest installers can be downloaded here:

       For 32 bit system:

https://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/tesseract/tesseract-ocr-w32-setup-v5.0.0-alpha.20200328.exe

     For 64 bit system:

https://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/tesseract/tesseract-ocr-w64-setup-v5.0.0-alpha.20200328.exe

After installing, set the path for tesseract in the environment variable.
          2. Now open jupyter notebook in  ANCONDA 
After setting path type 
"Pip install pytesseract"
In python command prompt.
By Which u can install pytesseract libraries.
If the input format is in pdf then we need to use the pdf2image python library.
pdf2image is a python library which converts PDF to a sequence of PIL Image objects using the pdftoppm library.
It can be done by running.
pip install pdf2image.
After this for pdf conversation we need to install poppler 
To install poppler in anaconda run the following code in anaconda prompt 
conda install -c conda-forge poppler
Now run the code.




all this is possible only with the help of dr. kiran kumar sir ,dr.pandeyan sir and sathis sir  
thanks
